# PCA-LSTM: Deep Learning Approach for Indian Large-Cap Stock Trading

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning approach using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to generate buy and sell signals for Indian large-cap stocks based on historical data. The strategy further optimizes returns by employing the Efficient Frontier method for portfolio allocation.

This project was developed as a Bachelor's thesis in 2021.

**Please Note:** This is a research-oriented, proof-of-concept implementation. It's provided as-is and may require further refinement for production use.

## Key Features

*   **Stock Trend Prediction:** Leverages LSTM networks to analyze time series data and predict stock price movements.
*   **Technical Indicator Analysis:** Incorporates a wide range of technical indicators as input features for the LSTM model.
*   **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):** Employs PCA to mitigate multicollinearity issues arising from the use of numerous technical indicators and reduce the complexity of the model.
*   **Portfolio Optimization (Efficient Frontier):** Utilizes the Efficient Frontier method to determine optimal portfolio allocations, balancing risk and return.

### Research Idea Summary

The stock market, despite its inherent unpredictability, offers potential for profit through trend and pattern analysis. This project explores the application of deep learning techniques, specifically LSTMs, to model and forecast stock market behavior. By combining technical analysis, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and portfolio optimization, the algorithm aims to provide actionable insights for traders and investors. The goal is to create a system that simplifies investment decisions, guiding users on what and when to trade, while considering risk management.


## Model Training and Testing

*   **Training:** To train a new LSTM model, ensure that the `load_model_flag` in `main.py` is set to `False`.  The script will train a new model for each stock in the `tickers` list. Hence, do not forget to create the `tickers` list as per your watchlist.
*   **Testing:** To test the model (or load a pre-trained model), set the `load_model_flag` in `main.py` to `True`.  Ensure that a pre-trained model exists at the specified `model_path` (checkpoints/lstm_model.keras)
